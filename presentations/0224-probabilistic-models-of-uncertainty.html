                  ordered just before Stalin's death should be paused. Watch what the other members of the politburo do
                  as Molotov (played by Michael Palin) makes his speech ("Hm....I've always been loyal to Stalin...").
                  What uncertainties are they contending with during Molotov's speech? Why do they look so stressed
                  during the speech?

              Example: Voting under uncertainty with a norm of unanimity
            </div>
            <div class="slide-stack-body">
              Imagine a person named "Nikita" who is a member of a 3-person committee that is taking a vote on a
              proposal. Nikita must choose whether to vote "yea" or "nay". Suppose the
              committee operates under a norm of unanimity. Specifically, if a vote is taken and some vote yea and the
              others vote nay, murderous violence will ensue in which some members of the committee will be killed. On
              the other hand if the vote is unanimous (either everyone votes "yea" or everyone votes "nay"), no one gets
              murdered. Model the uncertainty Nikita faces about the consequences of each vote he could
              cast.

              A probabilistic model of uncertainty has two elements:

                <li class="fragment">An exhaustive list of mutually exclusive <strong>possible events</strong>;</li>

              Given an exhaustive list of mutually exclusive possible events, a <strong>probability
                distribution</strong> over those events is a set of numbers, consisting of exactly one number assigned
              to each event in the list.
              <ul style="margin-top: 1em;">
                <li class="fragment">Each number is between 0 and 1 (inclusive).</li>
                <li class="fragment">Together, the numbers assigned to the events sum to 1.</li>
                <li class="fragment">The number assigned to each event is called the "probability of" that event.</li>
