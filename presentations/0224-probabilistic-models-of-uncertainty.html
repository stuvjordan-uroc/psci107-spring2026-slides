                  What uncertainties are they contending with during Molotov's speech? Why do they look so stressed

              Example: Voting under uncertainty with a norm of unanimity
            </div>
            <div class="slide-stack-body">
              Imagine a person named "Nikita" who is a member of a 3-person committee that is taking a vote on a
              proposal. Nikita must choose whether to vote "yea" or "nay". Suppose the
              committee operates under a norm of unanimity. Specifically, if a vote is taken and some vote yea and the
              others vote nay, murderous violence will ensue in which some members of the committee will be killed. On
              the other hand if the vote is unanimous (either everyone votes "yea" or everyone votes "nay"), no one gets
              murdered. Model the uncertainty Nikita faces about the consequences of each vote he could
              cast.

              to each event in the list.
